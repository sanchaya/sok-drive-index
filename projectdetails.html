“All India Gandhi Library to advance access to knowledge and spread the Mahatma’s message”

This digital repository is the result of a collaboration between Karnataka Gandhi Smaraka Nidhi and the Servants of Knowledge, a non-profit Section 8 association dedicated to advancing access to knowledge. The entire library was digitised in only 3 months and additional contributions were made by the Telangana Gandhi Smaraka Nidhi and the Andrapradesh Gandhi Smaraka Nidhi.

The library includes the volumes of Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi as well as hundreds of other Gandhi resources including Harijan, Young India, Indian Opinion, many Navijavan Trust pamphlets, the Pyarlel biographies, the Desai diaries and much more. In addition, the repository includes extensive collections of the works of Nehru and Ambedkar, the Sardar Patel correspondence, and works by numerous others such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. The multimedia collection also includes 129 audio files of Mahatma Gandhi speaking on All India Radio. The collection includes works in 12 languages.

Gandhi Bhavan already makes 1,272 public domain works available to the general public at <a href="https://archive.org/details/GandhiBhavan" target="_blank">https://archive.org/details/GandhiBhavan</a>. The presentation of the digital library to Gandhi organisations across the country allows those groups to access a much wider collection of works for noncommercial uses allowed by the Copyright Act of India, including access by the blind, research use, and uses in the course of instruction. In addition to the digital collection, the organisations are being furnished with an extensive treatise on the permitted uses of materials by public libraries.
